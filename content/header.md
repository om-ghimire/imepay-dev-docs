### FAQs

- When is Cron available for my platform?
    
    While the initial focus is on macOS and Google Calendar accounts, all other platforms are in the works or planned. Request your platform under Requests on this page for us to prioritize it higher and be in touch with you when early access for it is available.
    
- Where do I download Cron?
    
    You need an invite from a Cron user to create a Cron account. Once you have a Cron account, you can download Cron at [download.cron.com](http://download.cron.com) and log in.
    
- What's Cron's pricing?
    
    For early access, the only way you pay is in feedback — we hope this sounds fair. Afterwards, we'll always have plans that work for anyone.
    
- What's Cron's enterprise tier?
    
    Many of the biggest organizations in our industry already use Cron. Please contact [enterprise@cron.com](mailto:enterprise@cron.com) with your specific request. See [Security and Trust](https://www.notion.so/Security-and-Trust-0f1a86da2b5746158315a803f2e35e2f)  to find answers questions around security, SSO/SAML, and GDPR.
    
- How does Cron protect my privacy?
    
    See [Security and Trust](https://www.notion.so/Security-and-Trust-0f1a86da2b5746158315a803f2e35e2f)  on this topic or contact [security@cron.com](mailto:security@cron.com).
    
- Where can I report a security issue?
